### Problem type and tactic

This tactic is for analyzing the logic structures of statements and context in order to compare it with
other statements and context to see if they share a similar underlying logic structure, or are associated in
a logical manner such as one is being supported by, contradicted by, strengthened by, weakened by, inferred by,
resolved by, proceeded by the other statement.

**Typical use cases**
This tactic is frequently used in the following cases:
(1) You are given several statements and potentially a context, and are asked to compare their underlying
    pattern of reasoning, which cannot be properly captured by formal logic models such as deductive/inductive/abductive
    reasoning.

**Model and tactic outputs**
To solve this problem, you will simplify the statements and extract the essential logic structures from the statements,
then you will compare and analyze the semantics of the structures to see whether they are similar or not.

As the result, this tactic will produce semi-formal logic representations of the original statements which might take
the form of a logic chain, a causal graph, or a set of clauses that are conditioned on each other in a structured way;
Also, the tactic will provide a semantic analysis on these representations and show if they are logical similar or not.

**Tactic assumptions and requirements**

This tactic generally works with both real-world and hypothetical cases without any additional assumptions.
However, if the problem requires bringing in some commmonsense knowledge, this tactic will be explicit about what
commonsense is used in order to reach the conclusion.


### Tactic model template

**Model definition**

To apply this tactic, we build a model with the following components

[Instruction: the model built here needs to be self-contained and information are complete without referring to
the original question]

C1. Original statements and context: the statements and the context (if there is one) to be analyzed and compared
(DO put the complete and self-contained statements and context here)

C2. Assumptions and commonsense knowledge: the assumptions and commonsense knowledge that you think are necessary for
analyzing the statements, which, after being specified, make it a self-contained problem.

**Action space**

A1. Extract logic structure
- Input: the original statement
- Functionality: extract the underlying logic structure that represents the core semantic of a statement
- Output: a logic structure that takes the form of a logic chain, or a causal graph or a set of clauses
that are conditioned on each other in a structured way.

A2. Compare logic structure
- Input: two logic structures extracted by A1
- Functionality: compare and analyze two logic structures, check if they are similar or are associated in a
logical manner such as one is being supported by, contradicted by, strengthened by, weakened by, inferred by,
resolved by, proceeded by, summarized by the other statement.
- Output: a conclusion on how the logic structures are logically associated with each other with the given context.

A3. Aggregate and answer
- Input: All previous outputs produced by other actions
- Functionality: aggregate and summarize the outputs produced so far, and provide final answer to the specific problem
together with rationales.
- Output: the problem specific answer and the rationales that support the answer.

**Tactic Goal**
The goal of this tactic is to provide a detailed, step-by-step analysis on the provided statements by building the
model and apply the actions specified above, and finally provide the problem specific answer and the
rationales that support the answer.
