### Problem type and tactic
Critical Reading and Logical Analysis: This tactic involves systematically breaking down and analyzing
text-based information to identify key concepts, assess the accuracy of statements, and draw logical conclusions.

**Typical use cases**
- Determining the accuracy of statements in relation to a given context.
- Analyzing arguments or discussions to identify main points or underlying assumptions.
- Solving problems that require understanding and evaluating textual information.

**Model and tactic outputs**
- Model: The model involves textual information as input, typically consisting of a context or background information
  and a series of statements or questions related to this context.

- Outputs: The outputs are a reasoned evaluation of the statements, identifying which aligns best with the given
  context or the logical conclusion derived from the analysis.

**Tactic assumptions and requirements**
- Requirements: A clear, well-defined context or background information, and a set of statements or questions for
  analysis.

- Assumptions: The context provides sufficient information to evaluate the statements or questions. The statements are
  logically related to the context.



### Tactic model template

**Model definition**

[Instruction: the model built here needs to be self-contained and information are complete without referring to
the original question]

To apply this tactic, we build a model with the following components

- Context: A detailed description or narrative providing background information or outlining a specific scenario
  or argument.

- Statements: A set of claims, assertions, or questions that relate to the context.

- Analysis Components: These include (1) the identification of key concepts in the context, (2) the breakdown of
  each statement to understand its core assertion, and (3) a comparison of each statement against the context.

**Action space**
- Contextual Analysis: Reading and understanding the context; identifying key concepts.
- Statement Breakdown: Analyzing each statement to discern its main assertion.
- Comparative Evaluation: Comparing and contrasting each statement with the context.
- Logical Reasoning: Employing deductive and inductive reasoning to evaluate the alignment of each statement with the
  context.
- Elimination and Selection: Eliminating statements that do not align with the context and selecting the one that best
  matches.

**Tactic Goal**
The goal is to determine which statement best aligns with the provided context, or to draw a logical conclusion based
on the analysis of the context and the statements. This involves using critical thinking to assess the relevance and
accuracy of each statement in relation to the context, leading to an informed conclusion.
