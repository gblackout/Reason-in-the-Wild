### Problem type and tactic
Critical Reading and Logical Analysis: This tactic involves systematically breaking down and analyzing
text-based information in predicate logic to identify key concepts, assess the accuracy of statements,
and draw logical conclusions.

**Typical use cases**
- Determining the accuracy of statements in relation to a given context.
- Analyzing arguments or discussions to identify main points or underlying assumptions.
- Solving problems that require understanding and evaluating textual information.

**Model and tactic outputs**
- Model: The model involves textual information as input, typically consisting of a context or background information
  and a series of statements or questions related to this context.

- Outputs: The outputs are a reasoned evaluation of the predicate logic representations of statements, identifying
  which aligns best with the given context or the logical conclusion derived from the analysis.

**Tactic assumptions and requirements**
- Requirements: A clear, well-defined context or background information, and a set of statements or questions for
  analysis.

- Assumptions: The context provides sufficient information to evaluate the statements or questions. The statements are
  logically related to the context.



### Tactic model template

**Model definition**

[Instruction: the model built here needs to be self-contained and information are complete without referring to
the original question]

To apply this tactic, we build a model with the following components

- Context: A detailed description or narrative providing background information or outlining a specific scenario
  or argument.

- Statements: A set of claims, assertions, or questions that relate to the context.

In order to represent the question with predicate logic, we also need

- Constants: symbols that refer to specific elements of the domain of discourse.

- Predicates: These are properties or relations among elements in the domain of discourse. They are used to make
  statements about the domain that can be either true or false.

- Functions: These map elements from the domain of discourse to other elements or values.

- Variables: These symbols stand in for unspecified elements of the domain of discourse. They are quantified by
  existential or universal quantifiers.

- Quantifiers: These indicate whether the predicates must hold for all elements of the domain (universal quantifier ∀)
  or whether there exists some element for which the predicate holds (existential quantifier ∃).

- Logical Connectives: These include "and" (∧), "or" (∨), "not" (¬), "implies" (→), and "if and only if" (↔),
  used to build complex statements from simpler ones.

- Logical Formulas: These are well-formed combinations of predicates, functions, constants, variables,
  logical connectives, and quantifiers.

- Interpretations: An interpretation assigns a truth value to each formula based on an assignment of elements from
  the domain to the variables in the formula.

**Action space**

- Comparative Evaluation: Comparing and contrasting each formula with the context.

- Selection: select the formula that best matches the context.


**Tactic Goal**
The goal is to determine which statement best aligns with the provided context, or to draw a logical conclusion based
on the analysis of the context and the statements. This involves using critical thinking to assess the relevance and
accuracy of each statement in relation to the context, leading to an informed conclusion.
