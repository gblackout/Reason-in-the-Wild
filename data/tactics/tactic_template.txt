### Tactic model template

**Model definition**

[Instruction: the model built here needs to be self-contained and information are complete without referring to
the original question]

To apply this tactic, we build a model with the following components

<define the complete self-contained model specified by this tactic that represents the problem,
define all the components necessary to build such a model; for every such component, describe its
definition and the relation to other components>

**Action space**
<define a list of actions allowed; each action is defined over its input, functionality, and output; the list
should be exhaustive>

**Tactic Goal**
<define the end goal of this tactic. Depending on the problem type, it could be a value inferred from the actions
for an unknown variable; it could be true, false, or unknown state of a statement; or it could be that a certain
condition is met (e.g., reaching limited numbers of actions, ordering a pool of entities until the pool is empty)>
