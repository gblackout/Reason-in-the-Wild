Below is a reasoning question and a proposed program that seeks to solve the problem. You will carefully read the
question and figure out what steps/formalism/reasoning skills are needed to solve it. Then you will examine the
program and tell me if it represents a sensible solution to the question.

Specifically, your job is NOT to see if the program can or cannot solve the question, but if the program can capture
the underlying structure of the problem and produce outputs that help to derive the final answer. You will rate the
solution with respect to the following aspects:
    - Problem representation: does the program fully capture the underlying structure of the problem and show a
      step-by-step process starting from the input to the output?
        - A bad representation could be programs that
            - Miss important implementation or only have them in comments
            - Are shallow or low-effort code that put together the answers without showing how they are derived from
              the input.
    - Output-answer alignment: does the output of the program align with the final answer? Is there any ambiguity on
      interpreting the output?
        - A bad alignment could be that
            - The output is irrelevant to the answer; or could be used to support other conflicting answers
        - A good alignment should be that
            - The output is a strong evidence that supports only the given answer and not others
            - The output is simply the answer itself, or something based on which one can easily derive the final
              answer from
