Musicals are not films.\n\n### Hypotheses:\nDaveed Diggs won the best actor award.\n\n### Possible answers: Agree,Contradict,Uncertain\n\n=== Tactic\n\n### Tactic name\npredicate_logic_z3\n\n### Problem type and tactic\nThis tactic builds a formal logical model using predicate logic formalism with the help of python z3 lib.\nThis tactic is suitable for solving reasoning problems that involves deductive, inductive or, abductive reasoning.\nTo do so, the tactic will represent the problem as a self-contained first-order logic (FOL) system that consists\nof Constants, Predicates, Logic Variables, Quantifiers, Functions, Logic Operators, Grounded Facts, Logic Formulas\nand so on; then it will seek to perform formal reasoning with the help with z3 lib.\n\n**Typical use cases**\nThe tactic is suitable for problems that can be represented by an FOL system and solved by performing the following\nthree types of formal reasoning\n\n- Deductive reasoning: Given Facts and Logic Formulas, deduce new Facts from the system by applying the Formulas to the\n  Facts.\n- Inductive reasoning: Given Facts and Potentially some Formulas, induce new Formulas that entail the given Facts and\n  are consistent with the preexisting Formulas.\n- Abductive reasoning: Given Facts, Logic Formulas, and a consequence Fact, infer the missing Facts or Formulas, such\n  that the consequence Fact can be entailed by the system.\n\n**Model and tactic outputs**\n- Model: To apply the tactic, one builds a self-contained FOL system that fully represent the problem using z3 lib\n\n- Outputs: the z3 code should output either 'Agree', 'Contradict', or 'Uncertain'.\n  'Agree' means the Facts or Formulas agree with the system\n  'Contradict' means the Facts or Formulas contradict with the system\n  'Uncertain' means the Facts or Formulas contradict with the system\n\nNote that the type of reasoning and the system built for the problem determine:\n - How the output is interpreted.\n - Whether the output serves as the final answer or intermediate checks for the problem-specific answer\nFor example: for a deductive reasoning task with a given hypothesis, one builds the system to determine if the\nhypothesis Agree/Contradict/Uncertain to the system; for a deductive reasoning task where one wants to deduce all\npossible Facts, then one should infer all Facts that Agree with the system; for inductive reasoning, one infers the\nFormulas that Agree with the system; for abductive reasoning, one infers the Facts or Formulas that Agree with the\nconsequence and the system.\n\n\n### Tactic details\nYou will use the following python libs to solve the problem:\nAny builtin Python libs\nz3\n\n**Code template**\nYou will use the following code template to solve the problem.\n\n```python\nimport z3\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef check_model(solver):\n    res = solver.check()\n    if res == sat:\n        return 'sat'\n    elif res == unsat:\n        return 'unsat'\n

There is a strong analogy of human aging in the poem Callus 4.\n4. Callus 4 is written in an unusual iambic trimeter to convey a sense of speed over the waves.\n\n### Hypotheses:\nThere exists a poem written by an ancient Roman writer with a strong analogy of human aging.\n\n### Possible answers: Agree,Contradict,Uncertain\n\n=== Tactic\n\n### Tactic name\npredicate_logic_z3\n\n### Problem type and tactic\nThis tactic builds a formal logical model using predicate logic formalism with the help of python z3 lib.\nThis tactic is suitable for solving reasoning problems that involves deductive, inductive or, abductive reasoning.\nTo do so, the tactic will represent the problem as a self-contained first-order logic (FOL) system that consists\nof Constants, Predicates, Logic Variables, Quantifiers, Functions, Logic Operators, Grounded Facts, Logic Formulas\nand so on; then it will seek to perform formal reasoning with the help with z3 lib.\n\n**Typical use cases**\nThe tactic is suitable for problems that can be represented by an FOL system and solved by performing the following\nthree types of formal reasoning\n\n- Deductive reasoning: Given Facts and Logic Formulas, deduce new Facts from the system by applying the Formulas to the\n  Facts.\n- Inductive reasoning: Given Facts and Potentially some Formulas, induce new Formulas that entail the given Facts and\n  are consistent with the preexisting Formulas.\n- Abductive reasoning: Given Facts, Logic Formulas, and a consequence Fact, infer the missing Facts or Formulas, such\n  that the consequence Fact can be entailed by the system.\n\n**Model and tactic outputs**\n- Model: To apply the tactic, one builds a self-contained FOL system that fully represent the problem using z3 lib\n\n- Outputs: the z3 code should output either 'Agree', 'Contradict', or 'Uncertain'.\n  'Agree' means the Facts or Formulas agree with the system\n  'Contradict' means the Facts or Formulas contradict with the system\n  'Uncertain' means the Facts or Formulas contradict with the system\n\nNote that the type of reasoning and the system built for the problem determine:\n - How the output is interpreted.\n - Whether the output serves as the final answer or intermediate checks for the problem-specific answer\nFor example: for a deductive reasoning task with a given hypothesis, one builds the system to determine if the\nhypothesis Agree/Contradict/Uncertain to the system; for a deductive reasoning task where one wants to deduce all\npossible Facts, then one should infer all Facts that Agree with the system; for inductive reasoning, one infers the\nFormulas that Agree with the system; for abductive reasoning, one infers the Facts or Formulas that Agree with the\nconsequence and the system.\n\n\n### Tactic details\nYou will use the following python libs to solve the problem:\nAny builtin Python libs\nz3\n\n**Code template**\nYou will use the following code template to solve the problem.\n\n```python\nimport z3\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef check_model(solver):\n

Sam is either both addicted to coffee or other caffeinated drinks or leads very busy lives that include 12-hour work hours, or she is neither addicted to coffee and other caffeinated drinks nor leads very busy lives that include 12-hour work hours\n\n### Hypotheses:\nSam owns at least one coffeemaker and one blender in her home.\n\n### Possible answers: Agree,Contradict,Uncertain\n\n=== Tactic\n\n### Tactic name\npredicate_logic_z3\n\n### Problem type and tactic\nThis tactic builds a formal logical model using predicate logic formalism with the help of python z3 lib.\nThis tactic is suitable for solving reasoning problems that involves deductive, inductive or, abductive reasoning.\nTo do so, the tactic will represent the problem as a self-contained first-order logic (FOL) system that consists\nof Constants, Predicates, Logic Variables, Quantifiers, Functions, Logic Operators, Grounded Facts, Logic Formulas\nand so on; then it will seek to perform formal reasoning with the help with z3 lib.\n\n**Typical use cases**\nThe tactic is suitable for problems that can be represented by an FOL system and solved by performing the following\nthree types of formal reasoning\n\n- Deductive reasoning: Given Facts and Logic Formulas, deduce new Facts from the system by applying the Formulas to the\n  Facts.\n- Inductive reasoning: Given Facts and Potentially some Formulas, induce new Formulas that entail the given Facts and\n  are consistent with the preexisting Formulas.\n- Abductive reasoning: Given Facts, Logic Formulas, and a consequence Fact, infer the missing Facts or Formulas, such\n  that the consequence Fact can be entailed by the system.\n\n**Model and tactic outputs**\n- Model: To apply the tactic, one builds a self-contained FOL system that fully represent the problem using z3 lib\n\n- Outputs: the z3 code should output either 'Agree', 'Contradict', or 'Uncertain'.\n  'Agree' means the Facts or Formulas agree with the system\n  'Contradict' means the Facts or Formulas contradict with the system\n  'Uncertain' means the Facts or Formulas contradict with the system\n\nNote that the type of reasoning and the system built for the problem determine:\n - How the output is interpreted.\n - Whether the output serves as the final answer or intermediate checks for the problem-specific answer\nFor example: for a deductive reasoning task with a given hypothesis, one builds the system to determine if the\nhypothesis Agree/Contradict/Uncertain to the system; for a deductive reasoning task where one wants to deduce all\npossible Facts, then one should infer all Facts that Agree with the system; for inductive reasoning, one infers the\nFormulas that Agree with the system; for abductive reasoning, one infers the Facts or Formulas that Agree with the\nconsequence and the system.\n\n\n### Tactic details\nYou will use the following python libs to solve the problem:\nAny builtin Python libs\nz3\n\n**Code template**\nYou will use the following code template to solve the problem.\n\n```python\nimport z3\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef check_model(solver):\n    res = solver.check()\n    if res == sat:\n        return 'sat'\n    elif res == unsat:\n        return 'unsat'\n    else:\n        return 'unsolvable'\n\ndef check_constraint(solver, c):\n    pos_res = solver.check(c)\n    neg_res = solver.check(Not(c))\n\n    if (pos_res == sat) and (neg_res == unsat):\n        return 'Agree'\n    elif (pos_res == unsat) and (neg_res == sat):\n        return 'Contradict'\n    elif (pos_res == unknown) or (neg_res == unknown):\n        return 'unsolvable'\n    else:\n        return 'Uncertain'\n\ndef main():\n    s = z3.Solver()\n    <your code>\n```\n\n**Action space**\nYou will use and ONLY use the following actions to solve the problem.\nYou can apply actions in arbitrary order and arbitrary number of times.\n\n#A# Plan\n- Input: the problem given\n- Functionality: give a plan on how to solve the question, including a sketch of the solution, libs to be used,\nand code snippets\n- Output: text description of the plan and potential code snippets of the form\n    ```python\n    <your code>\n    ```\n\n#A# Build FOL model\n-

All customers who subscribe to HBO services prefer TV series to movies. \n6. James watches TV series in cinemas. \n\n### Hypotheses:\nJames goes to cinemas every week.\n\n### Possible answers: Agree,Contradict,Uncertain\n\n=== Tactic\n\n### Tactic name\npredicate_logic_z3\n\n### Problem type and tactic\nThis tactic builds a formal logical model using predicate logic formalism with the help of python z3 lib.\nThis tactic is suitable for solving reasoning problems that involves deductive, inductive or, abductive reasoning.\nTo do so, the tactic will represent the problem as a self-contained first-order logic (FOL) system that consists\nof Constants, Predicates, Logic Variables, Quantifiers, Functions, Logic Operators, Grounded Facts, Logic Formulas\nand so on; then it will seek to perform formal reasoning with the help with z3 lib.\n\n**Typical use cases**\nThe tactic is suitable for problems that can be represented by an FOL system and solved by performing the following\nthree types of formal reasoning\n\n- Deductive reasoning: Given Facts and Logic Formulas, deduce new Facts from the system by applying the Formulas to the\n  Facts.\n- Inductive reasoning: Given Facts and Potentially some Formulas, induce new Formulas that entail the given Facts and\n  are consistent with the preexisting Formulas.\n- Abductive reasoning: Given Facts, Logic Formulas, and a consequence Fact, infer the missing Facts or Formulas, such\n  that the consequence Fact can be entailed by the system.\n\n**Model and tactic outputs**\n- Model: To apply the tactic, one builds a self-contained FOL system that fully represent the problem using z3 lib\n\n- Outputs: the z3 code should output either 'Agree', 'Contradict', or 'Uncertain'.\n  'Agree' means the Facts or Formulas agree with the system\n  'Contradict' means the Facts or Formulas contradict with the system\n  'Uncertain' means the Facts or Formulas contradict with the system\n\nNote that the type of reasoning and the system built for the problem determine:\n - How the output is interpreted.\n - Whether the output serves as the final answer or intermediate checks for the problem-specific answer\nFor example: for a deductive reasoning task with a given hypothesis, one builds the system to determine if the\nhypothesis Agree/Contradict/Uncertain to the system; for a deductive reasoning task where one wants to deduce all\npossible Facts, then one should infer all Facts that Agree with the system; for inductive reasoning, one infers the\nFormulas that Agree with the system; for abductive reasoning, one infers the Facts or Formulas that Agree with the\nconsequence and the system.\n\n\n### Tactic details\nYou will use the following python libs to solve the problem:\nAny builtin Python libs\nz3\n\n**Code template**\nYou will use the following code template to solve the problem.\n\n```python\nimport z3\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef check_model(solver):\n    res = solver.check()\n    if res == sat:\n        return 'sat'\n    elif res == unsat:\n        return 'unsat'\n    else:\n        return 'unsolvable'\n\ndef check_constraint(solver, c):\n    pos_res = solver.check(c)\n    neg_res = solver.check(Not(c))\n\n    if (pos_res == sat) and (neg_res == unsat):\n        return 'Agree'\n    elif (pos_res == unsat) and (neg_res == sat):\n        return 'Contradict'\n    elif (pos_res == unknown) or (neg_res == unknown):\n        return 'unsolvable'\n    else:\n        return 'Uncertain'\n\ndef main():\n    s = z3.Solver()\n    <your code>\n```\n\n**Action space**\nYou will use and ONLY use the following actions to solve the problem.\nYou can apply actions in arbitrary order and arbitrary number of times.\n\n#A# Plan\n- Input: the problem given\n- Functionality: give a plan on how to solve the question, including a sketch of the solution, libs to be used,\nand code snippets\n- Output: text description of the plan and potential code snippets of the form\n    ```python\n    <your code>\n    ```\n\n#A# Build FOL model\n- Input: the original problem given\n- Functionality: build the FOL system that represents the problem;

Roversi is an Italian surname.\n2. Alba Roversi uses Roversi as a surname.\n3. Paolo Roversi uses Roversi as a surname.\n4. Roberto Roversi uses Roversi as a surname.\n5. Paolo Roversi is a photographer.\n6. A photographer is a professional or an amateur.\n\n### Hypotheses:\nPaolo is an amateur photographer.\n\n### Possible answers: Agree,Contradict,Uncertain\n\n=== Tactic\n\n### Tactic name\npredicate_logic_z3\n\n### Problem type and tactic\nThis tactic builds a formal logical model using predicate logic formalism with the help of python z3 lib.\nThis tactic is suitable for solving reasoning problems that involves deductive, inductive or, abductive reasoning.\nTo do so, the tactic will represent the problem as a self-contained first-order logic (FOL) system that consists\nof Constants, Predicates, Logic Variables, Quantifiers, Functions, Logic Operators, Grounded Facts, Logic Formulas\nand so on; then it will seek to perform formal reasoning with the help with z3 lib.\n\n**Typical use cases**\nThe tactic is suitable for problems that can be represented by an FOL system and solved by performing the following\nthree types of formal reasoning\n\n- Deductive reasoning: Given Facts and Logic Formulas, deduce new Facts from the system by applying the Formulas to the\n  Facts.\n- Inductive reasoning: Given Facts and Potentially some Formulas, induce new Formulas that entail the given Facts and\n  are consistent with the preexisting Formulas.\n- Abductive reasoning: Given Facts, Logic Formulas, and a consequence Fact, infer the missing Facts or Formulas, such\n  that the consequence Fact can be entailed by the system.\n\n**Model and tactic outputs**\n- Model: To apply the tactic, one builds a self-contained FOL system that fully represent the problem using z3 lib\n\n- Outputs: the z3 code should output either 'Agree', 'Contradict', or 'Uncertain'.\n  'Agree' means the Facts or Formulas agree with the system\n  'Contradict' means the Facts or Formulas contradict with the system\n  'Uncertain' means the Facts or Formulas contradict with the system\n\nNote that the type of reasoning and the system built for the problem determine:\n - How the output is interpreted.\n - Whether the output serves as the final answer or intermediate checks for the problem-specific answer\nFor example: for a deductive reasoning task with a given hypothesis, one builds the system to determine if the\nhypothesis Agree/Contradict/Uncertain to the system; for a deductive reasoning task where one wants to deduce all\npossible Facts, then one should infer all Facts that Agree with the system; for inductive reasoning, one infers the\nFormulas that Agree with the system; for abductive reasoning, one infers the Facts or Formulas that Agree with the\nconsequence and the system.\n\n\n### Tactic details\nYou will use the following python libs to solve the problem:\nAny builtin Python libs\nz3\n\n**Code template**\nYou will use the following code template to solve the problem.\n\n```python\nimport z3\nfrom z3 import *\n\ndef check_model(solver):\n    res = solver.check()\n    if res == sat:\n        return 'sat'\n    elif res == unsat:\n        return 'unsat'\n    else:\n        return 'unsolvable'\n\ndef check_constraint(solver, c):\n    pos_res = solver.check(c)\n    neg_res = solver.check(Not(c))\n\n    if (pos_res == sat) and (neg_res == unsat):\n        return 'Agree'\n    elif (pos_res == unsat) and (neg_res == sat):\n        return 'Contradict'\n    elif (pos_res == unknown) or (neg_res == unknown):\n        return 'unsolvable'\n    else:\n        return 'Uncertain'\n\ndef main():\n    s = z3.Solver()\n    <your code>\n```\n\n**Action space**\nYou will use and ONLY use the following actions to solve the problem.\nYou can apply actions in arbitrary order and arbitrary number of times.\n\n#A# Plan\n- Input: the problem given\n- Functionality: give a plan on how to solve the question, including a sketch of the solution, libs to be used,\nand code snippets\n- Output: text description of the plan and potential code snippets of the form\n    ```python\n    <your code>\n    ```\n\n#A# Build FOL model\n- Input: the original problem given\n- Functionality: build the FOL system that represents the problem;

When there is not enough information available to determine the meaning of a line of poetry, one should not form an opinion based on the insufficient information. Instead, one should simply acknowledge that it is impossible to determine what the line means.\n2. Though a researcher may know a great deal about a topic, she or he should not assume that all information relevant to the research is already in her or his possession. A good researcher always looks for further relevant information.\n3. When deciding which career to pursue, one needs to consider carefully all of the information one has. One should not choose a career solely on the basis of financial compensation; instead, one should consider other factors such as how likely one is to succeed at the career and how much one would enjoy it.\n4.
